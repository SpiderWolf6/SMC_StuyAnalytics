### Additional Notes
This is the StuyAnalytics website, presented by the Sports Management Club, which displays Catapult statistics and data visualizations for our Stuyvesant sports teams.
The project is called "vue-2" locally, and renamed to be SMC_StuyAnalytics.
Project is 90% complete, almost ready for deployment. 
Only bug is displaying the final graph in the frontend "Graph Page", by parsing the imageData which is currently being printed in the console.
